# HousePricingVisualAnalytics
In this repository you can find a project about house pricing in Seattle

This is a project for University about house pricing by Cinta Arnau and me, here we use tools like Jupyter Notebook, Tableau and VisualStudio Code for streamlit, to annalyze the data of a CSV file. We talk about data preprocessing and interpretation of a machine learning model. We use this model to display the results and useful plots in streamlit and to allow people to add more data into the dataset and predict whether a house with some characteristics is above the average price in Seattle. Also there is a section about data interpretation done in tableau that annalyzes the current pricing situation and some curious outliers.
